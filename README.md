# Project Goals

This project will take months to complete. Here are the goals I have so far.

1) Build JS logic within react to handle midi API
2) Build react front-end to display notes being played, chord visualizer, and keyboard visualizer
3) Build express back-end to connect to SQL database
4) Create SQL database with file paths to audio files
5) Deploy application to Heroku

# Future Ideas
- Add record functionality
- Add different synth sound packs
- Add sheet music learning
- Colorize keys
- Get chord API? https://rapidapi.com/jsdisco/api/piano-chords
